# Feedback sandwich

## Positives
I liked talking about technical subjects

## Negatives
It was difficult to get organised to do the workshop when I was busy
Ten minutes was ambitiously short

## Positives
I enjoyed answering questions
It made me re-visit some topics I rarely think about

## Future
I'm thinking about workshops on 
- debugging/understanding errors
- packages
- config files
- non-standard evaluation
- documentation

Let me know if you are interested
